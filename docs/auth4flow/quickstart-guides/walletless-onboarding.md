# Walletless Onboarding

The best way to implement Walletless Onboarding is still being thought through, all ideas and discussion are welcome in the community [Discord](https://discord.gg/S85mDy2qxE).

To be useful for a wide variety of DApps careful considerations need to be made around wallet/private key custody, storage of keys, fungible token custody requirments, capability providers, account linking, and more. This will probably entail providing several different configuration options to encompass different needs and regional requirements as well.

Until a plan to ensure safe and ethical usage of Walletless Onboard is in place I plan to integrate the self custody walletless [`fcl-web3auth-plugin`](https://github.com/nufi-official/fcl-web3auth-plugin)`(developed by` [`NuFi`](https://nu.fi)`)` for the Season 1 Flow Hackathon or another similar implementation of [web3auth.io](https://web3auth.io).
